    "Distillation is about having a \"teacher\" model transfer its learning to a \"student\" model, thereby allowing it to perform a _narrower_ task with comparable accuracy. To understand if our distillation had the desired effect, we typically _grade_ the student model before and after distillation - and show that the grades on that task improved significantly.\n",

    "To do this, we need a _grader_ - some model that is capable of \"reasoning\" on a given response to see if it meets our desired criteria for \"tone & style\". By using the same grader throughout, we can make sure we get a consistent outcome in terms of evaluations. To create an effective grader we take 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We curate a set of **baseline** questions and answers that are the gold standard for responses. A \"good\" grader would rank these very highly when asked.\n",
    "2. We define a set of **grading** criteria that the grader will use to come up with a score on the responses. These must be clear and consistent guidelines.\n",
    "3. We run the grader on that gold standard to see how our **assessment** rubric holds up. If the results look good, we have a grader ready to go - else we refine and retry.\n",
