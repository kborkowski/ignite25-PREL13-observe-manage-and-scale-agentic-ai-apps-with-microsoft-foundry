    "## Step 11: Understanding the Search Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine how Azure AI Search is being used behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Search Tool Works:\n",
    "1. **Agent receives question** → Agent analyzes user intent\n",
    "2. **Agent invokes search tool** → Searches the `zava-products` index\n",
    "3. **Azure AI Search returns results** → Top 5 relevant products\n",
    "4. **Agent processes results** → Formats response based on personality\n",
    "5. **User receives answer** → With actual product data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search Configuration:\n",
    "- **Index**: `zava-products` (product catalog)\n",
    "- **Query Type**: Simple (straightforward keyword matching)\n",
    "- **Top K**: 5 results (most relevant products)\n",
    "- **Automatic**: Agents decide when to search based on the question\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of This Architecture:\n",
    "- ✅ **Always current**: Agents access live product data\n",
    "- ✅ **Accurate**: Responses based on real inventory\n",
    "- ✅ **Scalable**: Can handle large product catalogs\n",
    "- ✅ **Flexible**: Each agent interprets search results differently\n",
    "- ✅ **Specialized**: Right agent for the right question"

    "Congratulations! 🎉 You've successfully created a multi-agent system with Azure AI Search using the Microsoft Agent Framework!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned:\n",
    "1. ✅ How to configure `HostedFileSearchTool` for Azure AI Search\n",
    "2. ✅ How to create specialized agents with search capabilities\n",
    "3. ✅ How to build a simple routing system for multi-agent collaboration\n",
    "4. ✅ How different agents can use the same search tool differently\n",
    "5. ✅ How to integrate Azure AI Search with the Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Azure AI Search Integration**: Using `HostedFileSearchTool` with `index_name` in `additional_properties`\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents with shared tools\n",
    "- **Search-Enhanced Responses**: Real-time data from product catalogs\n",
    "- **Agent Personality**: Same data, different presentation styles\n",
    "- **Intelligent Routing**: Directing queries to the right specialist\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Try the interactive session to ask your own questions\n",
    "- Modify agent instructions to change their behavior\n",
    "- Experiment with different search parameters (top_k, query_type)\n",
    "- Add more agents with different specializations\n",
    "- Explore filtering and advanced search queries\n",
